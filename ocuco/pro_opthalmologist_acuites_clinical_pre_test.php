The associate who is to carry out the pre-test can quickly greet this patient and bring them to the pre-test area. <br />

This is one suggested implementation of Acuitas. If this equipment was not available or was manual the screens would still be <br />

visible and the user could type directly into the application.</td>

	<li>Autorefractor</li>

	<li>Tonometer</li>

	<li>Keratometer</li>

				  <strong>Key Features </strong>

	<ul><li>One touch button for pulling data from each machine</li>

<li>All above equipment can be linked to one computer</li>

<li>User who performs the pre-test can also use the history screen to ask some preliminary questions, the answers to which <br />

				  	<strong>Key Benefits </strong>

	<ul>

		<li>Huge time savings in not having to write information on paper or type information into the application</li>

	<li>Eliminate margin for error in writing out data or re-keying data</li>

	<li>Free up staff to provide other services</li>

<li>Unblock the start of the patient journey</li>

<li>Having the equipment in an area out of the consulting room means that the equipment is accessible to a non optometrists</li>

	<li>The user does not have to be an OO to use this equipment so taking it out of the consulting room unblocks the use of<br /> 

	  these equipment</li>

<li>Pre-test allows expensive equipment to be shared between multiple consulting rooms.</li>

<li>The patient has been seen straight away and feels like they have been seen to, a short wait to go into the consulting<br /> 

  room is less of an issue for them</li></ul>	  </td>
