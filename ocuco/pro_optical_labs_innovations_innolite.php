                      prescriber and order entry operator. For instance, cylinder can be entered in a plus form, and will be transposed to a<br /> 

                      minus on the screen. Numbers can be entered with or without decimal points (-4.75 and -475 are both acceptable). </p>

                      To simplify and speed up the choice of options, lists appear with only those items that make sense for the current job.</p>
