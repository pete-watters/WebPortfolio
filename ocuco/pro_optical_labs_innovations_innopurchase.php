                    status. Inventory levels are shared with the lens database, ensuring that lenses chosen by the lens calculation programs are <br />

                    actually in stock. Inventory reports are generated using the Reports Module.</p>

                    <p><strong>

                        Inventory Manager Features Include:</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Windows&reg; user interface</strong><br />

                      Manipulate and view inventory data using a mouse and intuitive graphics. Multi-tasking lets inventory tasks such as purchase<br /> 

                      order generation continue to run while other programs are in use.</p>

                    <p><strong>Online vendor information</strong><br />

                      The software maintains data for each vendor including contact names, addresses, payment terms and shipping references.</p>

                    <p><strong>Purchase order generation</strong><br />

                      Order quantities are determined by replacing inventory items by using three methods: simple replenishment, minimum quantity,<br /> 

                      and order point ordering methods. Purchase orders can be generated for some or all of the vendors. Sets of preferred vendors<br /> 

                      can be saved and recalled later.</p>

                    <p><strong>Purchase order review</strong><br />

                      Once generated, purchase orders can be reviewed and edited. Using a Windows&reg; tab-style format, you can easily switch <br />

                      among information for several vendors.</p>

                    <p><strong>Automated receipt and updates </strong><br />

                      When shipments arrive, they are received against outstanding purchase orders by using a bar code scanner, manual counting<br /> 

                      or marking the entire order as received with a single entry. Inventory levels and back-order status are automatically updated.</p>

                    <p><strong>Multiple ordering options</strong><br />

                      Purchase orders can be printed or electronically transmitted as an OPC file. OPC transmissions can be scheduled to take<br /> 

                      place at selected times to take advantage of lower telephone rates or to meet ordering deadlines.</p>

                    <p><strong>Improved shortage management</strong> <br />

                      Long-lead back-order items can be reviewed and replaced if necessary by new purchase orders for equivalent items. Shortages<br /> 

                      can be filled with special orders that identify the trays waiting for material.</p>

                    <p><strong>Increased productivity</strong><br />

                      Following lens calculations Innovations searches the lens database for appropriate lenses in stock. Accurate inventory<br /> 

                      management assures that lenses chosen are actually on hand.</p>

                    <p><strong>Cost control</strong><br />

                      Closely monitoring inventory may help identify inefficient stocking patterns or savings associated with minimum orders or<br /> 

                      alternative vendors.</p>                    </td>
