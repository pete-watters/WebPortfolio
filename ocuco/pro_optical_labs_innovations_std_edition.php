                      Job entry sets up orders quickly and accurately using settings customized for your lab. Operators quickly adapt to Innovations<br /> 

                      well-designed graphics, clear text, and familiar Windows&reg; controls. The result is a job entry process that uses sophisticated<br /> 

                      computing to make complex order entry comfortable, accurate, and fast.</p>

                    <p><strong>Windows user interface</strong><br />

                      Text and graphics present more information in an easily understood layout. Operators can rapidly jump between screens or data<br /> 

                      items using standard Windows&reg; commands. </p>

                    <p><strong>Rapid data entry</strong><br />

                      All items can be entered rapidly from the keyboard, without the need for using the mouse. Common jobs require the fewest<br /> 

                      entries. Items such as prism are skipped for simple prescriptions, but can still be accessed with a single keystroke for more<br /> 

                      complex jobs.</p>

                    <p><strong>Immediate feedback</strong><br />

                      Error checking occurs with each entry, rather than after an entire form has been filled out. </p>

                    <p><strong>Online help</strong><br />

                      Help screens can be accessed any time to describe job entry items and software controls. </p>

                    <p><strong>Orders entered as written</strong><br />

                      Prescription entry is intuitive, since it mimics a written Rx. Information is entered in a form the prescriber and order entry<br /> 

                      operator are comfortable with. For instance, cylinder can be entered in a plus form and will be transposed to minus on the<br /> 

                      screen. Numbers entered with or without decimal points (&quot;-4.75 and &quot;-475&quot; are both acceptable). </p>

                    <p><strong>&quot;Smart&quot; drop-down lists</strong><br />

                      To simplify and speed up the choice of options, lists appear with only those items that make sense for the job at hand.</p>

                    <p><strong>User defined configurations</strong><br />

                      Job entry procedures followed in your lab will also be used by Innovations</p>

                    <p><strong>On screen job summary</strong><br />

                      A complete job summary builds up at the bottom of each screen as data is entered. This summary is always visible, no matter<br /> 

                      where the operator is in the order entry process. In addition, the operator can jump to any job entry screen by selecting<br /> 

                      the corresponding row in the job summary. </p>

                    <p><strong>Interfaces to other systems</strong><br />

                      A developer's kit is available to those who want to interface their own order entry system to Innovations.</p></td>
