Attracting new patients and recalling existing ones; performing eye examinations; dispensing spectacles,<br />

are not overstocked and that the labs achieve the best results first time, every time.<br />
And after having satisfied each patient, providing targeted aftercare so that the hard-earned customer<br />
that hides behind every patient remains loyal to your brand.<br /><br />

To do all this and make a profit is certainly a challenge. Ocucos software products Acuitas Optical, Acuitas Retail,<br />
