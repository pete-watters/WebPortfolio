                      Because all a storer&rsquo;s data (or virtually all, with individual organisations deciding if images are to be replicated, and with the<br /> 

                      store&rsquo;s audit trail information not being replicated) is located on the head office database as well as in the store, it provides<br /> 

                      for a centralised backup. <br />

                        <p>This means that, should the unlikely sequence of events occur which would cause the loss of both the store server and a loss <br />

                        of its offsite backups, then the store and its primary data (patients, clinical information, retail data and so on) can all be<br /> 

                        reconstructed by pulling it down from the head office server. This significantly reduces the possibility of a situation resulting in<br /> 

                        the complete loss of a store&rsquo;s data.<br /></p>

                    The installation of Acuitas Enterprise can also facilitate the integration or interface with other third party head office systems;<br /> 

                    this in itself can provide a defining reason to some organisations when deciding on the purchase of the system. Examples of<br /> 

                    these third party systems include SAP, ERP systems, data warehouses, or possibly even data mining tools for data and<br /> 

                    trend analyses. Without a central location of all data for all stores, this type of integration would be extremely difficult, if<br /> 

                    not impossible.

                    <p>As an example, the organisation may use SAP for data warehousing, inventory control, central ordering and so on. If this were<br /> 

                      the case, then Ocuco could develop custom interfaces to SAP whereby SAP can deliver stock control or other types of information<br /> 

                      into a set of &lsquo;interface tables&rsquo; (essentially a shared location in the head office database between the two systems). This information<br /> 

                      can then be processed by Ocuco procedures to distribute the updates to all stores. Equally, this data integration could be performed<br /> 

                      in the other direction &ndash; potentially with more benefits - with all sales, orders and other information populated at the stores being<br /> 

                      fed into interface data tables which can then be available for other head office systems to process (the organisation may have a <br />

                      separate central system for patient management and central recall, for instance). </p>

                    <p>Integration with other systems is not delivered &lsquo;out of the box&rsquo; by Ocuco, as the integration required will differ (oftentimes<br /> 

                      substantially) from business to business depending on their needs and the systems in use, etc.. <br />

                      Integration will therefore be treated as a bespoke project whereby Ocuco and the enterprise customer would carry out the<br /> 

                      analysis, design and implementation of the necessary interfaces, tailored specifically to suit the needs of that customer.</p></td>
