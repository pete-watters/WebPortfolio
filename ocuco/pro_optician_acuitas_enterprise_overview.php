				  <li><strong>It&rsquo;s a business model</strong><br />

Acuitas Enterprise facilitates uniformity across all store locations because it controls (or, more accurately, can control) that<br /> 

all stores see (or can see) the same examination list, use the same recall and referral letters, share the contents of various<br /> 

drop down lists and categories (such as hobbies, medical and marketing categories, examination results, etc.). Additionally,<br /> 

it provides facilities whereby stock, promotions, discounts, etc, can be configured and controlled centrally. 

Your Enterprise<br /> 

implementation is a project for Ocuco. Your specific sharing and control requirements are agreed in advance during the<br /> 

planning phase.</li>



<li><strong>It&rsquo;s a technical solution</strong><br />

Technically, the enterprise environment is achieved by use of what is known as &lsquo;replicatio&rsquo;. This is an Oracle database <br />

facility whereby each store can have its own separate database (to which their store application runs and stores information),<br /> 

and that that database is a sub-set of a &lsquo;master&rsquo; database existing at the head office. The head office contains all data from<br /> 

all stores &ndash; and it is then the process of replicating data which sends information up from the stores to head office and down<br /> 

to the stores from the head office.</li>



<li><strong>It&rsquo;s a set of software functionality features<br /> 

  </strong>There are implications of running in an enterprise environment within the Acuitas application itself.  In some instances, this<br /> 

  is the provision of additional features and functionality at either or both the head office and the local stores. In some instances,<br /> 

  this is the prevention of certain functions in the local stores which would be available in a stand-alone system.</li>

				  

				  <li><strong>It&rsquo;s a state of mind</strong><br />



By its nature, Enterprise forces a paradigm shift in thinking, away from the stores trading individually into a thought process<br /> 

of operating the business in a multi-location, distributed database environment. 

You will take on board certain characteristics<br /> 

of the business and the positive functional impact that the Enterprise environment causes. </li>
